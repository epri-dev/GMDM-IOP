[[GeographicalLocation-ACLineSegment]]
==== (Description) ACLineSegment

Inheritance path = <<GeographicalLocation-Conductor,Conductor>> => <<GeographicalLocation-ConductingEquipment,ConductingEquipment>> => <<GeographicalLocation-Equipment,Equipment>> => <<GeographicalLocation-PowerSystemResource,PowerSystemResource>> => <<GeographicalLocation-IdentifiedObject,IdentifiedObject>> => <<GeographicalLocation-Identity,Identity>>

endif::GeographicalLocation-description-profile[]

:ACLineSegment:
A line segment is a conductor or combination of conductors, with consistent electrical characteristics along its length, building a single electrical system that carries alternating current between two points in the power system.

The BaseVoltage at the two ends of a line segment shall have the same BaseVoltage.nominalVoltage. However, boundary lines may have slightly different BaseVoltage.nominalVoltages and variation is allowed. Larger voltage difference in general requires use of an equivalent branch.

Line segment impedances can be either directly described in electrical terms or physical line detail can be provided from which impedances can be calculated.

{lt}b{gt}Directly described impedances{lt}/b{gt}

For symmetrical, transposed three phase line segments, it is sufficient to use attributes of the line segment, which describe impedances and admittances for the entire length of the line segment. Additionally, line segment impedances can be computed by using line segment length and associated per length impedances.

Unbalanced modeling of impedances is supported by the per length phase impedance matrix (PerLengthPhaseImpedance) in conjunction with phase-to-sequence number mapping supplied by either ACLineSegmentPhase or WirePosition. The sequence numbers are referenced by the row and column attributes of the per length phase impedance matrix. This method enables single-phase and two-phase line segments, and transpositions of phases, to be described using the same per length phase impedance matrix. The length of the line segment is used in the computation of total impedance values for the line segment.

{lt}b{gt}Line detail characteristics{lt}/b{gt}

There are three approaches to providing line detail and all use WireAssembly to supply line positions:

{lt}ul{gt}

{lt}li{gt}Option 1 - WireAssembly supplies only line positions. ACLineSegmentPhase points to wire type and intraphase spacing and supplies the phase-to-sequence number mapping.{lt}/li{gt}

{lt}li{gt}Option 2 - WireAssembly supplies line position and, for each position, also supplies wire type and intraphase spacing. ACLineSegmentPhase supplies the phase-to-sequence number mapping.{lt}/li{gt}

{lt}li{gt}Option 3 - WireAssembly supplies line position and, for each position, also supplies wire type and intraphase spacing and phase. WireAssembly therefore supplies the phase-to-sequence number mapping and ACLineSegmentPhase is not needed.{lt}/li{gt}

{lt}/ul{gt}

A conductor, or group of conductors, with negligible impedance, that serve to connect other conducting equipment within a single substation. The BusbarSection class is intended to represent physical parts of bus bars no matter how that bus bar is constructed.

Voltage measurements are typically obtained from voltage transformers that are connected to busbar sections. A bus bar section may have many physical terminals but for analysis is modelled with exactly one logical terminal.

|crsUrn

|<<GeographicalLocation-String,String>>
|
A Uniform Resource Name (URN) for the coordinate reference system (crs) used to define 'Location.PositionPoints'.

An example would be the European Petroleum Survey Group (EPSG) code for a coordinate reference system, defined in URN under the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) namespace as: urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::XXXX, where XXXX is an EPSG code (a full list of codes can be found at the EPSG Registry web site http://www.epsg-registry.org/). To define the coordinate system as being WGS84 (latitude, longitude) using an EPSG OGC, this attribute would be urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::4236.

A profile should limit this code to a set of allowed URNs agreed to by all sending and receiving parties.

An electrical device consisting of two or more coupled windings, with or without a magnetic core, for introducing mutual coupling between electric circuits. Transformers can be used to control voltage and phase shift (active power flow).

A power transformer may be composed of separate transformer tanks that need not be identical.

A power transformer can be modelled with or without tanks and is intended for use in both balanced and unbalanced representations. A power transformer typically has two terminals, but may have one (grounding), three or more terminals.

The inherited association ConductingEquipment.BaseVoltage should not be used. The association from TransformerEnd to BaseVoltage should be used instead.
