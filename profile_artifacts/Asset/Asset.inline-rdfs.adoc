=== Concrete Classes

[[Asset-NoLoadTest]]
==== NoLoadTest

Inheritance path = <<Asset-TransformerTest,TransformerTest>> => <<Asset-IdentifiedObject,IdentifiedObject>> => <<Asset-Identity,Identity>>

:NoLoadTest:
No-load test results determine core admittance parameters. They include exciting current and core loss measurements from applying voltage to one winding. The excitation may be positive sequence or zero sequence. The test may be repeated at different voltages to measure saturation.
