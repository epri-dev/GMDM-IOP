#
# This is a stereotype to namespace mappings file. By convention
# a namespace mapping file must be named the same as the schema
# file used for the project under the ..\Schema directory but with
# the *.namespaces file extension. For example:

# These mapping files are intended to be used with EA project files
# such as .eap, .qea, and .feap files. They are particularly useful 
# for European/CGMES UML models where specific stereotypes are used
# represent different namespaced extensions. In such cases (or if 
# using this approach for your own extensions modeling) including
# this simple file along with your model will require no changes 
# made to your UML model.
# 
# If present, this file will override any baseuri tagged values 
# that may have been specified on the model. Simply deleting this 
# file and "refreshing" your CIMTool project folder will result in 
# CIMTool reverting back to using baseuri tags which is the historical 
# method for specifying namespaces.
#
# Order of precedence is as follows:
#
#
#    For attributes:
#
# 1. A stereotype specified on an attribute will always supersede 
#    all others specified at any level.
#
# 2. If an attribute does not have a stereotype defined on it then
#    CIMTool will honor any stereotype defined on the class.
#
# 3. If no stereotype exists on the class then CIMTool will check
#    for a stereotype on the package containing the class.
#
# 4. Finally, if a stereotype is not specified on the containing
#    package than CIMTool will walk up the package hierarchy until 
#    it finds a stereotype. If one is not found then the class will
#    be assigned the namespace of CIM schema used by the project 
#    e.g. http://iec.ch/TC57/CIM100#
#
#
#    For Classes:
#
# 1. A stereotype specified on the class will always supersede  
#    all others specified at any level.
#
# 2. If a class does not have a stereotype defined on it then
#    CIMTool will honor any stereotype defined on the package 
#    containing the class.
#
# 3. Finally, if a stereotype is not specified on the containing
#    package than CIMTool will walk up the package hierarchy until 
#    it finds a stereotype. If one is not found then the class will
#    be assigned the namespace of CIM schema used by the project 
#    e.g. http://iec.ch/TC57/CIM100#
#
#
#    For associations:
#
# 1. A stereotype specified on an association will always supersede 
#    all others specified at any level.
#
# 2. If an association does not have a stereotype defined on it then
#    CIMTool will look for stereotypes on the classes participating
#    on each end of the relationship. Precedence is as follows:
#       a. If the association is between two normative CIM classes
#          then the association will have CIM's namespace.
#       b. If one class is a normative CIM class and the other an
#          extension then the extension stereotype takes precedence.
#       c. If an association exists between two extension classes
#          each in a distinct namespace this is considered unresolvable
#          without an explicit stereotype on the association.
#
# 3. If no stereotype exists on the class then CIMTool will check
#    for a stereotype on the package containing the class.
#
# 4. Finally, if a stereotype is not specified there than CIMTool
#    will work up the package hierarchy until it find a stereotype.
#    If one is not found then the class take the namespace assigned
#    to the CIM schema for the project e.g. http://iec.ch/TC57/CIM100#
#
#
# Important notes on the <stereotype>=<namespace> mappings below:
#
# STEREOTYPES:
# Based on UML 2.5 specifications, UML stereotypes are considered
# case-insensitive and should NOT contain spaces. Therefore, the 
# stereotypes in the below mapping may be expressed either in
# the form they appear in the UML (e.g. NC for network codes)
# or in lowercase. Either is treated the same in CIMTool.
#
# NAMESPACES:
# W3C namespaces are case-sensitive. Both namespace prefixes and 
# the namespace URIs themselves are compared character by character 
# when determining if two names belong to the same namespace, according 
# to the W3C's Namespaces in XML 1.1. This means that 
# http://www.example.org/wine and http://www.Example.org/wine are  
# treated as different namespaces. 
#
# Therefore, when adding mappings care should be taken to account 
# for the above considerations.
