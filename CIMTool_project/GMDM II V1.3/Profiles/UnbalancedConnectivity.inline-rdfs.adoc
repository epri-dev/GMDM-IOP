:ACLineSegment:
A line segment is a conductor or combination of conductors, with consistent electrical characteristics along its length, building a single electrical system that carries alternating current between two points in the power system.

The BaseVoltage at the two ends of a line segment shall have the same BaseVoltage.nominalVoltage. However, boundary lines may have slightly different BaseVoltage.nominalVoltages and variation is allowed. Larger voltage difference in general requires use of an equivalent branch.

Line segment impedances can be either directly described in electrical terms or physical line detail can be provided from which impedances can be calculated.

{lt}b{gt}Directly described impedances{lt}/b{gt}

For symmetrical, transposed three phase line segments, it is sufficient to use attributes of the line segment, which describe impedances and admittances for the entire length of the line segment. Additionally, line segment impedances can be computed by using line segment length and associated per length impedances.

Unbalanced modeling of impedances is supported by the per length phase impedance matrix (PerLengthPhaseImpedance) in conjunction with phase-to-sequence number mapping supplied by either ACLineSegmentPhase or WirePosition. The sequence numbers are referenced by the row and column attributes of the per length phase impedance matrix. This method enables single-phase and two-phase line segments, and transpositions of phases, to be described using the same per length phase impedance matrix. The length of the line segment is used in the computation of total impedance values for the line segment.

{lt}b{gt}Line detail characteristics{lt}/b{gt}

There are three approaches to providing line detail and all use WireAssembly to supply line positions:

{lt}ul{gt}

{lt}li{gt}Option 1 - WireAssembly supplies only line positions. ACLineSegmentPhase points to wire type and intraphase spacing and supplies the phase-to-sequence number mapping.{lt}/li{gt}

{lt}li{gt}Option 2 - WireAssembly supplies line position and, for each position, also supplies wire type and intraphase spacing. ACLineSegmentPhase supplies the phase-to-sequence number mapping.{lt}/li{gt}

{lt}li{gt}Option 3 - WireAssembly supplies line position and, for each position, also supplies wire type and intraphase spacing and phase. WireAssembly therefore supplies the phase-to-sequence number mapping and ACLineSegmentPhase is not needed.{lt}/li{gt}

{lt}/ul{gt}

==== ACLineSegmentPhase

Inheritance path = <<UnbalancedConnectivity-PowerSystemResource,PowerSystemResource>> => <<UnbalancedConnectivity-IdentifiedObject,IdentifiedObject>> => <<UnbalancedConnectivity-Identity,Identity>>

:ACLineSegmentPhase:
A line segment phase represents one phase (or optionally the neutral) of an alternating current line segment.

Under most circumstances there is not a line segment phase for the neutral. However, if a wire assembly is being used and it does not specify phase, a line segment phase must exist for each position in the assembly (including the neutral).

:PowerTransformer:
An electrical device consisting of two or more coupled windings, with or without a magnetic core, for introducing mutual coupling between electric circuits. Transformers can be used to control voltage and phase shift (active power flow).

A power transformer may be composed of separate transformer tanks that need not be identical.

A power transformer can be modelled with or without tanks and is intended for use in both balanced and unbalanced representations. A power transformer typically has two terminals, but may have one (grounding), three or more terminals.

The inherited association ConductingEquipment.BaseVoltage should not be used. The association from TransformerEnd to BaseVoltage should be used instead.

|vectorGroup
|1..1
|<<UnbalancedConnectivity-String,String>>
|
Vector group of the transformer for protective relaying, e.g., Dyn1. For unbalanced transformers, this may not be simply determined from the constituent winding connections and phase angle displacements.

The vectorGroup string consists of the following components in the order listed: high voltage winding connection, mid voltage winding connection (for three winding transformers), phase displacement clock number from 0 to 11, low voltage winding connection

phase displacement clock number from 0 to 11. The winding connections are D (delta), Y (wye), YN (wye with neutral), Z (zigzag), ZN (zigzag with neutral), A (auto transformer). Upper case means the high voltage, lower case mid or low. The high voltage winding always has clock position 0 and is not included in the vector group string. Some examples: YNy0 (two winding wye to wye with no phase displacement), YNd11 (two winding wye to delta with 330 degrees phase displacement), YNyn0d5 (three winding transformer wye with neutral high voltage, wye with neutral mid voltage and no phase displacement, delta low voltage with 150 degrees displacement).

Phase displacement is defined as the angular difference between the phasors representing the voltages between the neutral point (real or imaginary) and the corresponding terminals of two windings, a positive sequence voltage system being applied to the high-voltage terminals, following each other in alphabetical sequence if they are lettered, or in numerical sequence if they are numbered: the phasors are assumed to rotate in a counter-clockwise sense.

==== PowerTransformerEnd

Inheritance path = <<UnbalancedConnectivity-TransformerEnd,TransformerEnd>> => <<UnbalancedConnectivity-IdentifiedObject,IdentifiedObject>> => <<UnbalancedConnectivity-Identity,Identity>>

:PowerTransformerEnd:
A PowerTransformerEnd is associated with each Terminal of a PowerTransformer.

The impedance values r, r0, x, and x0 of a PowerTransformerEnd represents a star equivalent as follows.

1) two PowerTransformerEnd-s shall be defined for a two Terminal PowerTransformer even if the two PowerTransformerEnd-s have the same rated voltage. The high voltage PowerTransformerEnd (TransformerEnd.endNumber=1) is the one used to exchange resistances (r, r0) and reactances (x, x0) of the PowerTransformer while the low voltage PowerTransformerEnd (TransformerEnd.endNumber=2) shall have zero impedance values.

2) for a three Terminal PowerTransformer the three PowerTransformerEnds represent a star equivalent with each leg in the star represented by r, r0, x, and x0 values.

3) For a three Terminal transformer each PowerTransformerEnd shall have g, g0, b and b0 values corresponding to the no load losses distributed on the three PowerTransformerEnds. The total no load loss shunt impedances may also be placed at one of the PowerTransformerEnds, preferably the end numbered 1, having the shunt values on end 1. This is the preferred way.

4) for a PowerTransformer with more than three Terminals the PowerTransformerEnd impedance values cannot be used. Instead use the TransformerMeshImpedance or split the transformer into multiple PowerTransformers.

Each PowerTransformerEnd must be contained by a PowerTransformer. Because a PowerTransformerEnd (or any other object) can not be contained by more than one parent, a PowerTransformerEnd can not have an association to an EquipmentContainer (Substation, VoltageLevel, etc).

The aggregate flag provides an alternative way of representing an aggregated (equivalent) element. It is applicable in cases when the dedicated classes for equivalent equipment do not have all of the attributes necessary to represent the required level of detail. In case the flag is set to "true" the single instance of equipment represents multiple pieces of equipment that have been modelled together as an aggregate equivalent obtained by a network reduction procedure. Examples would be power transformers or synchronous machines operating in parallel modelled as a single aggregate power transformer or aggregate synchronous machine.

The attribute is not used for EquivalentBranch, EquivalentShunt, EquivalentInjection and ExternalNetworkInjection.

[[UnbalancedConnectivity-TransformerEnd]]
==== TransformerEnd

Inheritance path = <<UnbalancedConnectivity-IdentifiedObject,IdentifiedObject>> => <<UnbalancedConnectivity-Identity,Identity>>

:TransformerEnd:
A conducting connection point of a power transformer. It corresponds to a physical transformer winding terminal. In earlier CIM versions, the TransformerWinding class served a similar purpose, but this class is more flexible because it associates to terminal but is not a specialization of ConductingEquipment.

=== Enumerations

[[UnbalancedConnectivity-OrderedPhaseCodeKind]]
==== OrderedPhaseCodeKind

In some use cases, the ordering of phases is important. The PhaseCode class does not represent order, but this class addresses such use cases. When two or more phases are present, the individual phases may occur in any order, but the neutral must always occur last. When only one phase and the neutral is present, that phase and the neutral may be re-ordered.

[[UnbalancedConnectivity-PhaseCode]]
==== PhaseCode

Enumeration of phase identifiers used to designate the combination of phase and/or neutral conductors at a terminal, measurement or equipment modelled as a single-line balanced equivalent.

This is an unordered enumeration of phase identifiers. Allows designation of phases for both transmission and distribution equipment, circuits and loads. The enumeration, by itself, does not describe how the phases are connected together or connected to ground. Ground is not explicitly denoted as a phase.

Residential and small commercial loads are often served from single-phase, or split-phase, secondary circuits. For the example of s12N, phases 1 and 2 refer to hot wires that are 180 degrees out of phase, while N refers to the neutral wire. Through single-phase transformer connections, these secondary circuits may be served from one or two of the primary phases A, B, and C. For three-phase loads, use the A, B, C phase codes instead of s12N.

The integer values are from IEC 61968-9 to support revenue metering applications.
