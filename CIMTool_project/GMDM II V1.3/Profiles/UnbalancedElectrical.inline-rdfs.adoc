:ACLineSegment:
A line segment is a conductor or combination of conductors, with consistent electrical characteristics along its length, building a single electrical system that carries alternating current between two points in the power system.

The BaseVoltage at the two ends of a line segment shall have the same BaseVoltage.nominalVoltage. However, boundary lines may have slightly different BaseVoltage.nominalVoltages and variation is allowed. Larger voltage difference in general requires use of an equivalent branch.

Line segment impedances can be either directly described in electrical terms or physical line detail can be provided from which impedances can be calculated.

{lt}b{gt}Directly described impedances{lt}/b{gt}

For symmetrical, transposed three phase line segments, it is sufficient to use attributes of the line segment, which describe impedances and admittances for the entire length of the line segment. Additionally, line segment impedances can be computed by using line segment length and associated per length impedances.

Unbalanced modeling of impedances is supported by the per length phase impedance matrix (PerLengthPhaseImpedance) in conjunction with phase-to-sequence number mapping supplied by either ACLineSegmentPhase or WirePosition. The sequence numbers are referenced by the row and column attributes of the per length phase impedance matrix. This method enables single-phase and two-phase line segments, and transpositions of phases, to be described using the same per length phase impedance matrix. The length of the line segment is used in the computation of total impedance values for the line segment.

{lt}b{gt}Line detail characteristics{lt}/b{gt}

There are three approaches to providing line detail and all use WireAssembly to supply line positions:

{lt}ul{gt}

{lt}li{gt}Option 1 - WireAssembly supplies only line positions. ACLineSegmentPhase points to wire type and intraphase spacing and supplies the phase-to-sequence number mapping.{lt}/li{gt}

{lt}li{gt}Option 2 - WireAssembly supplies line position and, for each position, also supplies wire type and intraphase spacing. ACLineSegmentPhase supplies the phase-to-sequence number mapping.{lt}/li{gt}

{lt}li{gt}Option 3 - WireAssembly supplies line position and, for each position, also supplies wire type and intraphase spacing and phase. WireAssembly therefore supplies the phase-to-sequence number mapping and ACLineSegmentPhase is not needed.{lt}/li{gt}

:ACLineSegmentPhase:
A line segment phase represents one phase (or optionally the neutral) of an alternating current line segment.

Under most circumstances there is not a line segment phase for the neutral. However, if a wire assembly is being used and it does not specify phase, a line segment phase must exist for each position in the assembly (including the neutral).

|sequenceNumber
|1..1
|<<UnbalancedElectrical-Integer,Integer>>
|
Sequence number provides the numbering for this line segment phase. When impedance is directly described, sequence number binds the phase to the column and row for entries in the per length phase impedance matrix (PhaseImpedanceData of PerLengthPhaseImpedance). When used in conjunction with a wire assembly description, sequence number associates the line segment phase to a position.

For a line segment not a part of a parallel line segment group, sequence number starts at one and increments by one through each line segment phase associated with the line segment. If there is a line segment phase for neutral, it is numbered last.

[[UnbalancedElectrical-LoadResponseCharacteristic]]
==== LoadResponseCharacteristic

Inheritance path = <<UnbalancedElectrical-IdentifiedObject,IdentifiedObject>> => <<UnbalancedElectrical-Identity,Identity>>

:LoadResponseCharacteristic:
Models the characteristic response of the load demand due to changes in system conditions such as voltage and frequency. It is not related to demand response.

If LoadResponseCharacteristic.exponentModel is True, the exponential voltage or frequency dependent models are specified and used as to calculate active and reactive power components of the load model.

The equations to calculate active and reactive power components of the load model are internal to the power flow calculation, hence they use different quantities depending on the use case of the data exchange.

The equations for exponential voltage dependent load model injected power are:

pInjection= Pnominal{asterisk} (Voltage/cim:BaseVoltage.nominalVoltage) {asterisk}{asterisk} cim:LoadResponseCharacteristic.pVoltageExponent

qInjection= Qnominal{asterisk} (Voltage/cim:BaseVoltage.nominalVoltage) {asterisk}{asterisk} cim:LoadResponseCharacteristic.qVoltageExponent

pInjection = Pnominal{asterisk} (Frequency/(Nominal frequency)){asterisk}{asterisk}cim:LoadResponseCharacteristic.pFrequencyExponent

qInjection = Qnominal{asterisk} (Frequency/(Nominal frequency)){asterisk}{asterisk}cim:LoadResponseCharacteristic.qFrequencyExponent

Note that both voltage and frequency exponents could be used together so the full equation would be:

pInjection = Pnominal{asterisk} (Voltage/(cim:BaseVoltage.nominalVoltage)){asterisk}{asterisk}cim:LoadResponseCharacteristic.pVoltageExponent {asterisk} (Frequency/(base frequency)){asterisk}{asterisk}cim:LoadResponseCharacteristic.pFrequencyExponent

qInjection = Qnominal{asterisk} (Voltage/(cim:BaseVoltage.nominalVoltage)){asterisk}{asterisk}cim:LoadResponseCharacteristic.qVoltageExponent {asterisk} (Frequency/(base frequency)){asterisk}{asterisk}cim:LoadResponseCharacteristic.qFrequencyExponent

The voltage and frequency expressed in the equation are values obtained from solved power flow. Base voltage and base frequency are those derived from the connectivity of the static network model.

Where:

1) {asterisk} means "multiply" and {asterisk}{asterisk} is "raised to the power of";

2) Pnominal and Qnominal represent the active power and reactive power at nominal voltage as any load described by the voltage exponential model shall be given at nominal voltage. This means that EnergyConsumer.p and EnergyConsumer.q are at nominal voltage.

3) After power flow is solved:

-pInjection and qInjection correspond to SvPowerflow.p and SvPowerflow.q respectively.

- Voltage corresponds to SvVoltage.v at the TopologicalNode where the load is connected.

:PerLengthPhaseImpedance:
The per length phase impedance matrix expresses impedance and admittance parameters per unit length for n-conductor unbalanced line segments. A phase impedance matrix contains both self impedances for each phase and mutual impedances between pairs of phases. The matrix is stored in symmetric lower triangular format where the diagonal entries represent self-impedances (and have the same value in row and column) and the off diagonal entries represent phase-to-phase impedances (and have different row and column values).

The matrix can be use to express impedances for both non-coupled and coupled line segments. Coupled line segments share a single per length phase impedance matrix whose entries reflect the self and mutual impedances of all the phases of all the wires.

|conductorCount
|1..1
|<<UnbalancedElectrical-Integer,Integer>>
|
Conductor count identifies the number of phase, neutral, and other wires represented in the phase impedance matrix and constrains the number of elements in the matrix. Typically, Kron reduction is used for incorporating effects of neutral impedance in the phase conductor values (so conductor count only considers phase wires), but neutrals can be included in the matrix (in which case conductor count would include the neutral wire(s)). For a phase impedance matrix associated with the lines of a coupled line segment group, the conductor count reflects the total of the conductors associated with all the coupled line segments in the group.

==== PhaseImpedanceData

Inheritance path = <<UnbalancedElectrical-Identity,Identity>>

:PhaseImpedanceData:
Per length phase impedance matrix entry describes impedance and conductance matrix element values for a specific row and column of the matrix.

The phases to which each entry applies can be determined by means of the row and column attributes which bind to a sequence number provided in either ACLineSegmentPhase or WirePosition (which also specify phase). Due to physical symmetry that is reflected in the matrix, only the lower triangle of the matrix is populated with the row and column method. That is, the column attribute is always less than or equal to the row attribute.

:PowerTransformer:
An electrical device consisting of two or more coupled windings, with or without a magnetic core, for introducing mutual coupling between electric circuits. Transformers can be used to control voltage and phase shift (active power flow).

A power transformer may be composed of separate transformer tanks that need not be identical.

A power transformer can be modelled with or without tanks and is intended for use in both balanced and unbalanced representations. A power transformer typically has two terminals, but may have one (grounding), three or more terminals.

The inherited association ConductingEquipment.BaseVoltage should not be used. The association from TransformerEnd to BaseVoltage should be used instead.

endif::UnbalancedElectrical-description-profile[]

:PowerTransformerEnd:
A PowerTransformerEnd is associated with each Terminal of a PowerTransformer.

The impedance values r, r0, x, and x0 of a PowerTransformerEnd represents a star equivalent as follows.

1) two PowerTransformerEnd-s shall be defined for a two Terminal PowerTransformer even if the two PowerTransformerEnd-s have the same rated voltage. The high voltage PowerTransformerEnd (TransformerEnd.endNumber=1) is the one used to exchange resistances (r, r0) and reactances (x, x0) of the PowerTransformer while the low voltage PowerTransformerEnd (TransformerEnd.endNumber=2) shall have zero impedance values.

2) for a three Terminal PowerTransformer the three PowerTransformerEnds represent a star equivalent with each leg in the star represented by r, r0, x, and x0 values.

3) For a three Terminal transformer each PowerTransformerEnd shall have g, g0, b and b0 values corresponding to the no load losses distributed on the three PowerTransformerEnds. The total no load loss shunt impedances may also be placed at one of the PowerTransformerEnds, preferably the end numbered 1, having the shunt values on end 1. This is the preferred way.

4) for a PowerTransformer with more than three Terminals the PowerTransformerEnd impedance values cannot be used. Instead use the TransformerMeshImpedance or split the transformer into multiple PowerTransformers.

Each PowerTransformerEnd must be contained by a PowerTransformer. Because a PowerTransformerEnd (or any other object) can not be contained by more than one parent, a PowerTransformerEnd can not have an association to an EquipmentContainer (Substation, VoltageLevel, etc).

[[UnbalancedElectrical-RegulatingControl]]
==== RegulatingControl

Inheritance path = <<UnbalancedElectrical-PowerSystemResource,PowerSystemResource>> => <<UnbalancedElectrical-IdentifiedObject,IdentifiedObject>> => <<UnbalancedElectrical-Identity,Identity>>

:RegulatingControl:
Specifies a set of equipment that works together to control a power system quantity such as voltage or flow.

Remote bus voltage control is possible by specifying the controlled terminal located at some place remote from the controlling equipment.

The specified terminal shall be associated with the connectivity node of the controlled point. The most specific subtype of RegulatingControl shall be used in case such equipment participate in the control, e.g. TapChangerControl for tap changers.

For flow control, load sign convention is used, i.e. positive sign means flow out from a TopologicalNode (bus) into the conducting equipment.

The attribute minAllowedTargetValue and maxAllowedTargetValue are required in the following cases:

- For a power generating module operated in power factor control mode to specify maximum and minimum power factor values;

- Whenever it is necessary to have an off center target voltage for the tap changer regulator. For instance, due to long cables to off shore wind farms and the need to have a simpler setup at the off shore transformer platform, the voltage is controlled from the land at the connection point for the off shore wind farm. Since there usually is a voltage rise along the cable, there is typical and overvoltage of up 3 to 4 kV compared to the on shore station. Thus in normal operation the tap changer on the on shore station is operated with a target set point, which is in the lower parts of the dead band.

The attributes minAllowedTargetValue and maxAllowedTargetValue are not related to the attribute targetDeadband and thus they are not treated as an alternative of the targetDeadband. They are needed due to limitations in the local substation controller. The attribute targetDeadband is used to prevent the power flow from moving the tap position in circles (hunting) that is to be used regardless of the attributes minAllowedTargetValue and maxAllowedTargetValue.

|discrete
|1..1
|<<UnbalancedElectrical-Boolean,Boolean>>
|
If true, indicates that regulation is performed in the simulation in a discrete mode. If false, indicates that non-discrete regulation is used in the simulation. This applies to equipment with discrete controls, e.g. tap changers and shunt compensators.

|<<UnbalancedElectrical-Boolean,Boolean>>
|
The flag tells if regulation is enabled.

|mode (enumeration)
|0..1
|<<UnbalancedElectrical-RegulatingControlModeKind,RegulatingControlModeKind>>
|
The regulating control mode presently available. This specification allows for determining the kind of regulation without need for obtaining the units from a schedule.

|monitoredPhase (enumeration)
|0..1
|<<UnbalancedElectrical-PhaseCode,PhaseCode>>
|
Phase voltage controlling this regulator, measured at regulator location.

|targetDeadband
|0..1
|<<UnbalancedElectrical-Float,Float>>
|
This is the deadband set on the controller. It is used with discrete control to avoid excessive tap changes in tap changers and state changes in shunt compensator banks while regulating. The units in which deadband is expressed are based on RegulatingControl.mode. The attribute shall be a positive value or zero. If RegulatingControl.discrete is set to "false", the RegulatingControl.targetDeadband is to be ignored in simulations. If TapChanger.ctRatio or TapChanger.ptRatio are populated, deadband shall be expressed in secondary units.

Note that for instance, if the targetValue is 100 kV and the targetDeadband is 2 kV the range is from 99 to 101 kV.

|targetValue
|0..1
|<<UnbalancedElectrical-Float,Float>>
|
The target value set on the controller. It is the starting value for a steady state solution. This value can be used for the target value without the use of schedules. The value has the units appropriate to the mode attribute.

If used for a TapChangerControl and if TapChanger.ctRatio or TapChanger.ptRatio are populated, the target value shall be expressed in secondary units. As an example, with PT ratio of 60 on a 12.47 KV distribution system, a phase to ground PT has a ratio of 7200 volts primary to 120 volts secondary. If the required primary target is 7128 volts for a single phase tap changer then the value of targetValue would equal 118.8 volts secondary (7128/60).

|Terminal
|1..1
|<<UnbalancedElectrical-Terminal,Terminal>>
|
The terminal associated with this regulating control. The terminal is associated instead of a node, since the terminal could connect into either a topological node or a connectivity node. Sometimes it is useful to model regulation at a terminal of a bus bar object.

[[UnbalancedElectrical-PhaseCode]]
==== PhaseCode

Enumeration of phase identifiers used to designate the combination of phase and/or neutral conductors at a terminal, measurement or equipment modelled as a single-line balanced equivalent.

This is an unordered enumeration of phase identifiers. Allows designation of phases for both transmission and distribution equipment, circuits and loads. The enumeration, by itself, does not describe how the phases are connected together or connected to ground. Ground is not explicitly denoted as a phase.

Residential and small commercial loads are often served from single-phase, or split-phase, secondary circuits. For the example of s12N, phases 1 and 2 refer to hot wires that are 180 degrees out of phase, while N refers to the neutral wire. Through single-phase transformer connections, these secondary circuits may be served from one or two of the primary phases A, B, and C. For three-phase loads, use the A, B, C phase codes instead of s12N.

The integer values are from IEC 61968-9 to support revenue metering applications.
